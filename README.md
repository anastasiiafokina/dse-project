<h1>🌍 Travel Project</h1>

An interactive Python project that helps you visualize travel routes by finding the three nearest cities to your chosen location. The project uses geographical data, calculates travel times, and generates an interactive map for exploration.

<h2>🎯 Features</h2>

- **Find Nearest Cities**
    Input a city name to get the three geographically nearest cities based on latitude and longitude.
- **Travel Time Calculation**
    Estimate travel time between the selected city and its nearest cities, assuming specific conditions.
- **Interactive Maps**
    Visualize the route and nearest cities on an interactive map with tooltips and markers. The map automatically highlights connections with route lines.
- **Visualization**
    Obtaining statistics: how much time was spent in countries during a round-the-world trip, how much time was spent crossing borders or moving around densely populated cities
